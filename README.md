## User Story
- 🕯️AS A software engineer looking to integrate a CI/CD pipeline in a codebase
I WANT a full-stack application that runs test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch and automatically deploys to Render when the code is merged to main
SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements and that the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch
🕯️

## Acceptance Criteria
- 🕯️GIVEN a full-stack application
WHEN I upload new features to the application
THEN I should be making Pull Requests to a develop branch first
WHEN I create a Pull Request to a develop branch
THEN I should be executing a GitHub Action that checks the Cypress component tests
WHEN I see that the tests pass on GitHub Action
THEN I should see those test results on GitHub Action and merge the code
WHEN I push the code from the develop branch to the main branch
THEN I should see that another GitHub Action triggers and should automatically deploy to Render🕯️
-------------------------------------------------------

## Testing
- 🧪TESTING: will be dissplayed within GitHub actions
